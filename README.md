Title: Idea Storage Webpage

Introduction:

This webpage was born out of a need identified by one of my children. They had brilliant ideas that they often forgot about. In response to this, I decided to create a simple solution as a weekend project. The result is a webpage that allows users to store and retrieve their ideas easily.

Technology Stack:

The webpage is built using PHP - Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

Key Features:

Users can create accounts and log in securely.
Once logged in, users can write down their ideas and categorize them.
Users can view and edit their ideas whenever they want.
The webpage uses a Router to manage the flow of data and establish paths for transmitting information between networks.
